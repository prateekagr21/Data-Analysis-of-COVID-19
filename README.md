# Analyzing The Pandemic !
*After few months of relief, the second all-India surge of the Covid-19 pandemic has been more devastating than the first. It has also appeared to be different from last yearâ€™s surge in several ways, increasing worries and anxiety.* \
*The infection is spreading at a faster pace in every age group. At present, there is very little data that shows how long immunity lasts in the younger population. However, those who have comorbidities at a young age at high risk.* \
*All over India Vaccination has started but yet there seem a far road up ahead to get over with this pandemic.*

In order to do this Analysis , I gathered dynamic data of all the states of india with the number of cases they had at that particular June day ! \
I have done the visualization part by Plotting meaningful graphs with the help of libraries such as Matplotlib and seaborn. \
